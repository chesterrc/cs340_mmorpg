# Description   
This is a project for the CS340 Databases class where we set up a MySQL database that connects to an express server using Node.js. 

The goal for this database implementation is to create a website that showcases 
players, regions, monsters, and items from a mythical MMORPG. In this website, we are able to edit, delete, or add the different entities as a typical database should. 

Further implementation could be made with creating leaderboards and expanding on the entities.
